<h1 id="header"> Why I love Lana Del Rey</h1>
<p>Over the past couple years Lana Del Rey <em>(formerly known as Elizabeth Grant, Lizzie Grant, etc)</em> has become my <strong>favorite artist</strong>. Lana Del Rey is extremley talented and an artist I can listen to no matter my mood. You may still be wondering, "why does she love Lana Del Rey so much?", I'll tell you why:</p>
<ul>
<li> Lana Del Rey has such a unique voice. She has certain vocal qualities of crooners and singers of the mid century, yet she also shifts her voice and uses more modern technique.</li>
<li> Lana Del Rey is an <strong>incredible lyricist.</strong> She creates beautiful images with her lyrics, and truly builds out the world in her songs. When listening to her songs you truly feel like you're there with her.  </li>
<li> Her music videos are <em>unbelievable.</em> While many of her videos are remarkable, Lana Del Rey's video for her song "National Anthem" is unbeat. The video stars <strong>A$AP Rocky</strong>  as JFK, and Lana Del Rey playing <em>both Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Onassis</em>. The video is beautifully shot, and really captures Del Rey's vintage-Americana aesthetic.  </li>  
 <li>So much of Lana Del Rey's personally life is a mystery, the biggest thing we have of her is her music. Because of her enigma-like prescense her music is able to really belong with her audience instead of "who it might be about".</li>
</ul>
